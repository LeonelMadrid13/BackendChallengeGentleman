# ‚òÅÔ∏è Weather API Project

Build your own Weather API that fetches real-time weather data from a third-party source, caches it for performance, and serves it to your users!

---

## üå¶Ô∏è Overview

In this project, you‚Äôll create an API server that lets users request the weather for a specific city or location. Instead of storing weather data yourself, your API will **fetch data from a free weather provider** (like Visual Crossing or OpenWeather), then **cache the results in memory** (for example, with Redis) to speed up repeat requests.

You‚Äôll learn about:

- Working with third-party APIs
- Handling environment variables (like API keys)
- Caching responses for efficiency (using Redis or similar)
- Error handling and rate limiting

## üöÄ How it Works

1. **Client sends a request** to your API, e.g. `GET /weather?city=London`.
2. **API checks the cache**: If the weather for London was recently fetched, it returns the cached result.
3. **If not cached**, your API requests weather data from the external weather service.
4. **Response is saved in cache** (for a set time, like 12 hours), and then returned to the client.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Fetch weather by city** from a 3rd party API (you choose the provider)
- **In-memory cache** with expiration (e.g. Redis)
- **Environment variables** for API keys and sensitive config
- **Error handling** for invalid cities or external API issues
- **Rate limiting** to protect your server from abuse

## üß™ Getting Started

1. **Clone this repo** and install dependencies

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-api.git
    cd weather-api
    npm install
    ```

2. **Set up environment variables**

    - Create a `.env` file and add your API keys and Redis connection string:

        ```
        WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
        REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
        ```

3. **Start the API server**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. **Test the API**

    Try:

    ```
    GET http://localhost:3000/weather?city=London
    ```
